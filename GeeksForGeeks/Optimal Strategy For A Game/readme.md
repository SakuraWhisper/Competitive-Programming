## Approach
- Observe the pattern , we have two choices to select and similarly opponent has too.
- we can select select from left or right
- we select the one which lead us to maximum.
- We can't follow the greedy approach as it may result that opponent can have larger value.
- we will use the memorization to optimize our solution
- Hurray! Done
