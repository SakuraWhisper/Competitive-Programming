## **[Java Datatypes](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-datatypes)** 
Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):<br><ul><li>A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.</li><li>A short is a 16-bit signed integer.</li><li>An int is a 32-bit signed integer.</li><li>A long is a 64-bit signed integer.</li></ul><br>Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.<br>To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor.<br>Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html<br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
