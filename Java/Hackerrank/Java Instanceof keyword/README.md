The Java *instanceof* operator is used to test if the object or instance is an instanceof the specified type.


In this problem we have given you three classes in the editor:


* Student class
* Rockstar class
* Hacker class


In the main method, we populated an *ArrayList* with several instances of these classes. *count* method calculates how many instances of each type is present in the ArrayList. The code prints three integers, the number of instance of Student class, the number of instance of Rockstar class, the number of instance of Hacker class.


But some lines of the code are missing, and you have to fix it by modifying only  *[SVG image]*  lines! Don't add, delete or modify any extra line. 


To restore the original code in the editor, click on the top left icon in the editor and create a new buffer.
