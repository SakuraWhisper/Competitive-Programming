Java's *System.out.printf* function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using *printf*.


To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor; you must format and print the input to complete the solution.

**Input Format**

Every line of input will contain a *String* followed by an *integer*.   

Each *String* will have a maximum of  *[SVG image]*  alphabetic characters, and each *integer* will be in the inclusive range from  *[SVG image]*  to  *[SVG image]* .

**Output Format**

In each line of output there should be two columns:   

The first column contains the *String* and is left justified using exactly  *[SVG image]*  characters.   

The second column contains the *integer*, expressed in exactly  *[SVG image]*  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

**Sample Input**


```
java 100
cpp 65
python 50

```
**Sample Output**


```
================================
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
================================

```
**Explanation**

Each *String* is left\-justified with trailing whitespace through the first  *[SVG image]*  characters. The leading digit of the *integer* is the  *[SVG image]*  character, and each *integer* that was less than  *[SVG image]*  digits now has leading zeroes.
