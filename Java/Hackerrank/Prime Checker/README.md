You are given a class *Solution* and its *main* method in the editor. Your task is to create a class *Prime*. The class *Prime* should contain a single method *checkPrime*. 


The locked code in the editor will call the *checkPrime* method with one or more integer arguments. You should write the *checkPrime* method in such a way that the code prints only the [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).


Please read the code given in the editor carefully. Also please do not use method overloading! 


**Note:** 
You may get a compile time error in this problem due to the statement below:



```
  BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));

```

This was added intentionally, and you have to figure out a way to get rid of the error. 

**Input Format**

There are only five lines of input, each containing one integer.

**Output Format**

There will be only four lines of output. Each line contains only prime numbers depending upon the parameters passed to *checkPrime* in the *main* method of the class *Solution*. In case there is no prime number, then a blank line should be printed.

**Sample Input**


```
2
1
3
4
5

```
**Sample Output**


```
2 
2 
2 3 
2 3 5 

```
