> "In computing, *End Of File* (commonly abbreviated *EOF*) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source."
>  — ([Wikipedia: End\-of\-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file))


The challenge here is to read  *[SVG image]*  lines of input until you reach *EOF*, then number and print all  *[SVG image]*  lines of content.


**Hint:** Java's *Scanner.hasNext()* method is helpful for this problem.

**Input Format**

Read some unknown  *[SVG image]*  lines of input from *stdin(System.in)* until you reach *EOF*; each line of input contains a non\-empty *String*.

**Output Format**

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

**Sample Input**


```
Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.

```
**Sample Output**


```
1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.

```
