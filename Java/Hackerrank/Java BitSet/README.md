## **[Java BitSet](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-bitset)** 
Java's BitSet class implements a vector of bit values (i.e.: () or ()) that grows as needed, allowing us to easily manipulate bits while optimizing space (when compared to other collections). Any element having a bit value of is called a set bit.<br>Given BitSets, and , of size where all bits in both BitSets are initialized to , perform a series of operations. After each operation, print the number of set bits in the respective BitSets as two space-separated integers on a new line.<br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
