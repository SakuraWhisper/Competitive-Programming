## **[Java Substring Comparisons](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-string-compare)** 
We define the following terms:<br><ul><li>Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.</li><li>A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.</li></ul><br>Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:<br><br>For example, <code>ball &lt; cat</code>, <code>dog &lt; dorm</code>, <code>Happy &lt; happy</code>, <code>Zoo &lt; ball</code>.<br>Given a string, , and an integer, , complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length .<br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><code></code><br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><code></code><br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
