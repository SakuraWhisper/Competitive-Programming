## **[Java BigDecimal](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-bigdecimal)** 
Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!<br>Given an array, , of real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that is printed as , and is printed as . If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., ), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).<br>Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must rearrange array 's elements according to the instructions above.<br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>
