According to Wikipedia, a factory is simply an object that returns another object from some other method call, which is assumed to be "new".


In this problem, you are given an interface *Food*. There are two classes *Pizza* and *Cake* which implement the *Food* interface, and they both contain a method *getType*().


The main function in the *Main* class creates an instance of the *FoodFactory* class. The *FoodFactory* class contains a method *getFood(String)* that returns a new instance of *Pizza* or *Cake* according to its parameter.


You are given the partially completed code in the editor. Please complete the *FoodFactory* class.


**Sample Input 1**



```
cake

```

**Sample Output 1**



```
The factory returned class Cake
Someone ordered a Dessert!

```

**Sample Input 2**



```

```

**Sample Output 2**



```
