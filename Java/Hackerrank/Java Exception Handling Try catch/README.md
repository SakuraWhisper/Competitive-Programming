## **[Java Exception Handling (Try-catch)](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-exception-handling-try-catch)** 
Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – often changing the normal flow of program execution. (Wikipedia)<br>Java has built-in mechanism to handle exceptions. Using the try statement we can test a block of code for errors. The catch block contains the code that says what to do if exception occurs.<br>This problem will test your knowledge on try-catch block.<br>You will be given two integers and as input, you have to compute . If and are not bit signed integers or if is zero, exception will occur and you have to report it. Read sample Input/Output to know what to report in case of exceptions.<br>Sample Input 0:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
