Write the following code in your editor below:


1. A class named *Arithmetic* with a method named *add* that takes  *[SVG image]*  integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.
2. A class named *Adder* that inherits from a superclass named *Arithmetic*.


Your classes should not be be  *[SVG image]* .

**Input Format**

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin; a locked code stub will test your submission by calling the *add* method on an *Adder* object and passing it  *[SVG image]*  integer parameters.

**Output Format**

You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Your *add* method must return the sum of its parameters. 

**Sample Output**

The *main* method in the *Solution* class above should print the following:



```
My superclass is: Arithmetic
42 13 20

```
