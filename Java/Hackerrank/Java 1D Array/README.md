## **[Java 1D Array](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-1d-array-introduction)** 
An array is a simple data structure used to store a collection of data in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in the collection is accessed using an index, and the elements are easy to find because they're stored sequentially in memory.<br>Because the collection of elements in an array is stored as a big block of data, we typically use arrays when we know exactly how many pieces of data we're going to have. For example, you might use an array to store a list of student ID numbers, or the names of state capitals. To create an array of integers named that can hold four integer values, you would write the following code:<br>This sets aside a block of memory that's capable of storing integers. Each integer storage cell is assigned a unique index ranging from to one less than the size of the array, and each cell initially contains a . In the case of , we can store integers at indices , , , and . Let's say we wanted the last cell to store the number ; to do this, we write:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
