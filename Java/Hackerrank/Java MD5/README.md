## **[Java MD5](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-md5)** 
MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a -bit hash value. Here are some common uses for MD5:<br><ul><li>To store a one-way hash of a password.</li><li>To provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact.</li></ul><br>MD5 is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, ); however, the security of MD5 has been severely compromised, most infamously by the Flame malware in . The CMU Software Engineering Institute essentially considers MD5 to be "cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use".<br>Given an alphanumeric string, , denoting a password, compute and print its MD5 encryption value.<br>
