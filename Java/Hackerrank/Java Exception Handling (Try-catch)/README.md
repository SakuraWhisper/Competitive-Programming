Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions ‚Äì anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing ‚Äì often changing the normal flow of program execution. (Wikipedia)

Java has built\-in mechanism to handle exceptions. Using the *try* statement we can test a block of code for errors. The *catch* block contains the code that says what to do if exception occurs. 


This problem will test your knowledge on try\-catch block.


You will be given two integers  *[SVG image]*  and  *[SVG image]*  as input, you have to compute  *[SVG image]* . If  *[SVG image]*  and  *[SVG image]*  are not  *[SVG image]*  bit signed integers or if  *[SVG image]*  is zero, exception will occur and you have to report it. Read sample Input/Output to know what to report in case of exceptions.


**Sample Input 0:**



```
10
3

```

**Sample Output 0:**



```
3

```

**Sample Input 1:**



```
10
Hello

```

**Sample Output 1:**



```
java.util.InputMismatchException

```

**Sample Input 2:**



```
10
0

```

**Sample Output 2:**



```
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

```

**Sample Input 3:**



```
23.323
0

```

**Sample Output 3:**



```
java.util.InputMismatchException

```
