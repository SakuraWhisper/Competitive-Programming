## **[Java Comparator](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-comparator)** 
Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.<br>The Player class is provided for you in your editor. It has fields: a String and a integer.<br>Given an array of Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.<br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>
