```
In computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added.(Wikipedia)

```

A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true:
1\. if it is an empty string
2\. if A and B are correct, AB is correct,
3\. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and \[A] are also correct.


Examples of some correctly balanced strings are: "{}()", "\[{()}]", "({()})"   



Examples of some unbalanced strings are: "{}(", "({)}", "\[\[", "}{" etc.  



Given a string, determine if it is balanced or not. 

**Input Format**

There will be multiple lines in the input file, each having a single non\-empty string. You should read input till end\-of\-file.


The part of the code that handles input operation is already provided in the editor.

**Output Format**

For each case, print 'true' if the string is balanced, 'false' otherwise.

**Sample Input**


```
{}()
({()})
{}(
[]

```
**Sample Output**


```
true
true
false
true

```
