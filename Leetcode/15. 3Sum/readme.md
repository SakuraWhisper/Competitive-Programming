## Approach
1. First we will sort the array which will allow us to use two way pointer depending on the sum of the value
2. We will be loop i from 0...n
3. Then use the two way pointer left and right
4. To avoid duplicates, we will try that i must not repeat and and j and k too
5. Hurray we have got the answers
