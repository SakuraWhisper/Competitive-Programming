1. Start from the reverse of the array of nums1 because it is of size m+n
2. Limit m>0 and n>0
3. But becoz of this limit m can be empty and n can have some value
4. So we need to copy all the values from the nums2

From point `2`, limit by n>0 and have some conidtion m<=0 states that whether the m is empty but check n
