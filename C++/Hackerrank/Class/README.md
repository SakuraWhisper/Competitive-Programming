## **[Class](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-tutorial-class)** 
Classes in C++ are user defined types declared with keyword class that has data and functions . Although classes and structures have the same type of functionality, there are some basic differences. The data members of a class are private by default and the members of a structure are public by default. Along with storing multiple data in a common block, it also assigns some functions (known as methods) to manipulate/access them. It serves as the building block of Object Oriented Programming.<br>It also has access specifiers, which restrict the access of member elements. The primarily used ones are the following:<br><ul><li>public: Public members (variables, methods) can be accessed from anywhere the code is visible.</li><li>private: Private members can be accessed only by other member functions, and it can not be accessed outside of class.</li></ul><br>Class can be represented in the form of<br><br><br><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>
