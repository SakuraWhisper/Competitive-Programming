## **[Exceptional Server](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/exceptional-server)** 
In this challenge, you are required to handle error messages while working with small computational server that performs complex calculations.
It has a function that takes large numbers as its input and returns a numeric result. Unfortunately, there are various exceptions that may occur during execution.<br>Complete the code in your editor so that it prints appropriate error messages, should anything go wrong. The expected behavior is defined as follows:<br><ul><li>If the compute function runs fine with the given arguments, then print the result of the function call.</li><li>If it fails to allocate the memory that it needs, print Not enough memory.</li><li>If any other standard C++ exception occurs, print Exception: S where is the exception's error message.</li><li>If any non-standard exception occurs, print Other Exception.</li></ul><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
