## **[Abstract Classes - Polymorphism](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/abstract-classes-polymorphism)** 
Abstract base classes in C++ can only be used as base classes. Thus, they are allowed to have virtual member functions without definitions.<br>A cache is a component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the results of an earlier computation, or the duplicates of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store. Thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.<br>One of the popular cache replacement policies is: "least recently used" (LRU). It discards the least recently used items first.<br>For example, if a cache with a capacity to store 5 keys has the following state(arranged from most recently used key to least recently used key) -<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
