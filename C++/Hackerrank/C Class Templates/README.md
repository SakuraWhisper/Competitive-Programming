## **[C++ Class Templates](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-class-templates)** 
A class template provides a specification for generating classes based on parameters. Class templates are generally used to implement containers. A class template is instantiated by passing a given set of types to it as template arguments. Here is an example of a class, MyTemplate, that can store one element of any type and that has just one member function divideBy2, which divides its value by 2.<br>It is also possible to define a different implementation of a template for a specific type. This is called Template Specialization. For the template given above, we find that a different implementation for type will be more useful, so we write a function to print the element:<br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
