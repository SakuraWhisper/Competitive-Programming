## **["Hello World!" in C](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/hello-world-c)** 
Objective<br>In this challenge, we will learn some basic concepts of C that will get you started with the language. You will need to use the same syntax to read input and write output in many C challenges. As you work through these problems, review the code stubs to learn about reading from stdin and writing to stdout.<br>Task<br>This challenge requires you to print on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout. If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.<br>Example<br>The required output is:<br><br><br><br><ul><li></li></ul><br><br><ul><li></li></ul><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><code></code><br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><code></code><br><br>
