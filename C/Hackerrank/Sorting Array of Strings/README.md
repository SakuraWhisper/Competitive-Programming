## **[Sorting Array of Strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sorting-array-of-strings)** 
To sort a given array of strings into lexicographically increasing order or into an order in which the string with the lowest length appears first, a sorting function with a flag indicating the type of comparison strategy can be written. The disadvantage with doing so is having to rewrite the function for every new comparison strategy.<br>A better implementation would be to write a sorting function that accepts a pointer to the function that compares each pair of strings. Doing this will mean only passing a pointer to the sorting function with every new comparison strategy.<br>Given an array of strings, you need to implement a function which sorts the strings according to a comparison function, i.e, you need to implement the function :<br><code>void string_sort(const char **arr,const int cnt, int (*cmp_func)(const char* a, const char* b)){
    
}</code><br><br><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><code></code><br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><code></code><br><br>
