## **[Functions in C](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/functions-in-c)** 
Objective<br>In this challenge, you will learn simple usage of functions in C. Functions are a bunch of statements grouped together. A function is provided with zero or more arguments, and it executes the statements on it. Based on the return type, it either returns nothing (void) or something.

A sample syntax for a function is<br><code> return_type function_name(arg_type_1 arg_1, arg_type_2 arg_2, ...) {
     ...
        ...
        ...
        [if return_type is non void]
         return something of type `return_type`;
    }</code><br><br><code></code><br><code></code><br><br>Write a function <code>int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d)</code> which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them. <br><br>There is not built in <code>max</code> function in C.  Code that will be reused is often put in a separate function, e.g. <code>int max(x, y)</code> that returns the greater of the two values.  <br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>
