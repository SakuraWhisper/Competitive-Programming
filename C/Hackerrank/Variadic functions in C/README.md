## **[Variadic functions in C](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/variadic-functions-in-c)** 
Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments. In C programming, a variadic function will contribute to the flexibility of the program that you are developing.<br>The declaration of a variadic function starts with the declaration of at least one named variable, and uses an ellipsis as the last parameter, e.g.<br><code>int printf(const char* format, ...);</code><br>In this problem, you will implement three variadic functions named , and to calculate sums, minima, maxima of a variable number of arguments. The first argument passed to the variadic function is the count of the number of arguments, which is followed by the arguments themselves.<br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><code></code><br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><code></code><br><br>
