Objective
This challenge will help you learn the concept of recursion.<br>A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. The C programming language supports recursion. But while using recursion, one needs to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.<br>To prevent infinite recursion, statement (or similar approach) can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and other doesn't.<br><code>void recurse() {
    .....
    recurse()  //recursive call
    .....
}
int main() {
    .....
    recurse(); //function call
