## Approach
1. Observe the pattern - `leaf` is the node which have both right and left `null`
2. Use the recursive pattern to create all paths using the [backtracking](./../../../Backtracking/README.md) method. You can relate to [combination](../../../Combination/Combination/readme.md) function
3. Done Hurray!!
