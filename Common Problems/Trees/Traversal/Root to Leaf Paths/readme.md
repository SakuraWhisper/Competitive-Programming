## Approach
1. Observe the pattern - `leaf` is the node which have both right and left `null`
2. Use the recursive pattern to create all paths using the [Depth-First Search](../../../Traversal%20OR%20Search%20Algorithm%20-%20Trees%20And%20Graphs/Depth-First%20Search/readme.md) with the [backtracking](./../../../Backtracking/README.md) method. 
3. Done Hurray!!
