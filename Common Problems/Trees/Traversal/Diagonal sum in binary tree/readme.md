## Approach
1. Observe the pattern, you will find that we need to get all the right nodes linked to elements in the queue.
2. Unlike traditional level order traversal, here level means nodes that right to the elements.
3. Repeat this recursive function and keep adding sum 
4. Hurray ! You are done.
