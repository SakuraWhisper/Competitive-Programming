## Knapsack Problem

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

##### Sample Input 0
```
    weight = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    values = [60, 100, 120, 135, 200]
    max_weight = 100
```

##### Sample Output 0
`420`

##### Sample Input 1
```
    weight = [10, 20, 30]
    values = [60, 100, 120]
    max_weight = 50
```

##### Sample Output 1
`220`
