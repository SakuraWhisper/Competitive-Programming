# Combination Method
The combination method in algorithms and programming refers to generating all possible combinations of a given set of items. A combination is a selection of items where the order does not matter. 

### 1. **Recursive Approach**
   - **Concept**: A recursive function is used to generate combinations by including or excluding each element of the input list.
   - **Example (Python)**:
     ```python
     def combinations(arr, k):
         if k == 0:
             return [[]]
         if not arr:
             return []
         with_first = [[arr[0]] + rest for rest in combinations(arr[1:], k-1)]
         without_first = combinations(arr[1:], k)
         return with_first + without_first

     arr = [1, 2, 3]
     k = 2
     print(combinations(arr, k))  # Output: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
     ```

### 2. **Iterative Approach**
   - **Concept**: An iterative approach typically involves nested loops or using a stack to generate combinations.
   - **Example (Python)**:
     ```python
     from itertools import combinations

     arr = [1, 2, 3]
     k = 2
     result = list(combinations(arr, k))
     print(result)  # Output: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
     ```

### 3. **Backtracking**
   - **Concept**: This approach explores all potential combinations by constructing them incrementally, backtracking when necessary.
   - **Example (Python)**:
     ```python
     def backtrack(start, end, temp_list):
         if len(temp_list) == k:
             result.append(temp_list[:])
             return
         for i in range(start, end):
             temp_list.append(arr[i])
             backtrack(i + 1, end, temp_list)
             temp_list.pop()

     arr = [1, 2, 3]
     k = 2
     result = []
     backtrack(0, len(arr), [])
     print(result)  # Output: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
     ```

### 4. **Bit Masking**
   - **Concept**: Each combination is represented as a binary number, where a `1` indicates that an element is included in the combination.
   - **Example (Python)**:
     ```python
     def bitmask_combinations(arr, k):
         n = len(arr)
         result = []
         for i in range(1 << n):
             subset = [arr[j] for j in range(n) if (i & (1 << j))]
             if len(subset) == k:
                 result.append(subset)
         return result

     arr = [1, 2, 3]
     k = 2
     print(bitmask_combinations(arr, k))  # Output: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
     ```

### 5. **Mathematical Approach (Combinatorial Logic)**
   - **Concept**: Use combinatorial logic or mathematical functions to generate combinations directly based on formulas (often using libraries like NumPy or specialized combinatorial libraries).

### Usage in Programming:
These methods can be used in various contexts, such as generating test cases, solving combinatorial problems, and working with subsets of data.

Each method has its advantages depending on the problem's constraints, such as the size of the input set, the required combination length, and whether the solution should be generated iteratively or recursively.

####  We will be using **backtracking** method for combinational problem solving. You are free to use any above method.
