## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm finds a shortest path tree from a single source node, by building a set of nodes that have minimum distance from the source.

The graph has the following:
* vertices, or nodes, denoted in the algorithm by vv or uu;
* weighted edges that connect two nodes: (u,vu,v) denotes an edge, and w(u,v)w(u,v) denotes its weight. In the diagram on the right, the weight for each edge is written in gray.
