## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

It is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs. But, it does not work for the graphs with negative cycles (where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative).

#### Floyd Warshall Algorithm Applications
* To find the shortest path is a directed graph
* To find the transitive closure of directed graphs
* To find the Inversion of real matrices
* For testing whether an undirected graph is bipartite
