An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a *leap day*. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365\.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.


In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:


* The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
	+ The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
		- The year is also evenly divisible by 400\. Then it is a leap year.


This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. [Source](http://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html) 


**Task** 


Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean `True`, otherwise return `False`.


Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the `is_leap` function. It is only necessary to complete the `is_leap` function. 

**Input Format**

Read  *[SVG image]* , the year to test. 

**Constraints**

 *[SVG image]*  

**Output Format**

The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.

**Sample Input 0**


```
1990

```

**Sample Output 0**


```
False

```

**Explanation 0**

1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.
