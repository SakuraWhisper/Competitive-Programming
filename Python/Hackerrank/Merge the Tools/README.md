Consider the following:<br><ul><li>A string, , of length where .</li><li>An integer, , where is a factor of .</li></ul><br>We can split into substrings where each subtring, , consists of a contiguous block of characters in . Then, use each to create string such that:<br><ul><li>The characters in are a subsequence of the characters in .</li><li>Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index in occurs at a previous index in , then do not include the character in string .</li></ul><br>Given and , print lines where each line denotes string .<br>Example<br><br><br><br><br><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><br><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
