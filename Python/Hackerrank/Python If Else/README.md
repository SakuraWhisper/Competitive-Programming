Check Tutorial tab to know how to to solve.<br>Task
Given an integer,`n`, perform the following conditional actions:<br>
<ul>
<li>If `n` is odd, print Weird</li>
<li>If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of `2` to `5`, print Not Weird</li>
<li>If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of `6` to `20`, print Weird</li>
<li>If `n` is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird</li></ul>

**Sample Input 0**  
`3`

**Sample Output 0**  
`Weird`

**Explanation 0**  
`n`=3
`n` is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.

**Sample Input 1**  
`24`

**Sample Output 1**  
`Not Weird`

**Explanation 1**  
`n`=24
`n` > 20 and `n` is even, so it is not weird.
