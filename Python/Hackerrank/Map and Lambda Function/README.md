## **[Map and Lambda Function](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/map-and-lambda-expression)** 
Let's learn some new Python concepts! You have to generate a list of the first fibonacci numbers, being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.<br>Concept<br>The <code>map()</code> function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables. <br>
Let's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.  <br>Lambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function. In simple words, it is a function that has only one line in its body. It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.<br><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
