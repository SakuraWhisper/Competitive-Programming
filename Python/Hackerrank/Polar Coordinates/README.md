## **[Polar Coordinates](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/polar-coordinates)** 
Polar coordinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.<br>A complex number<br><br>A polar coordinate ()<br>is completely determined by modulus and phase angle .

If we convert complex number to its polar coordinate, we find:
: Distance from to origin, i.e.,
: Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive -axis to the line segment that joins to the origin.
