Kevin and Stuart want to play the '**The Minion Game**'.  



**Game Rules**  



Both players are given the same string, S.


Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string **S**.

Stuart has to make words starting with *consonants*.  

Kevin has to make words starting with *vowels*.   

The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.
  



**Scoring**  

A player gets `+1` point for each occurrence of the substring in the string  **S**.  



**For Example**:  

String **S** = BANANA

Kevin's vowel beginning word \= *ANA*  

Here, *ANA* occurs twice in *BANANA*. Hence, Kevin will get `2` Points.
