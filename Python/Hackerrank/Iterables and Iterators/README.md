The *itertools* module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an *iterator algebra* making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure *Python*. 


To read more about the functions in this module, check out their [documentation here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html). 


You are given a list of **N** lowercase English letters. For a given integer **K**, you can select any **K** indices (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.



Find the **probability** that **at least** one of the **K** indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'.


**Input Format**


The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the integer **N**, denoting the length of the list. The next line consists of **N** space-separated lowercase English letters, denoting the elements of the list. 

The third and the last line of input contains the integer **K**, denoting the number of indices to be selected.


**Output Format**


Output a single line consisting of the probability that at least one of the **K** indices selected contains the letter:'a'.

**Note**: The answer must be correct up to 3 decimal places. 


**Constraints**

*All the letters in the list are lowercase English letters.*


**Sample Input**



```
4 
a a c d
2

```

**Sample Output**



```
0.8333

```

**Explanation**
All possible unordered tuples of length  comprising of indices from  to  are:


Out of these 6 combinations, 5 of them contain either index 1 or index 2 which are the indices that contain the letter 'a'.

Hence, the answer is 5/6.
