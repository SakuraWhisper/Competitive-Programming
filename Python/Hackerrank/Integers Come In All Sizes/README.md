## **[Integers Come In All Sizes](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-integers-come-in-all-sizes)** 
Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. 
There is no limit in size as there is: (c++ int) or (C++ long long int).<br>As we know, the result of grows really fast with increasing .
Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

#### Task

Read four numbers,a ,b ,c  and d, and print the result of a^b+c^d.

#### Input Format

Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.<br>Constraints
Print the result of on one line

#### Sample Input
```

29
7
27
```

#### Sample Output
