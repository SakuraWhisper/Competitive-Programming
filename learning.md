Some points to remember

* whenever you see search problem, always try to use search alogorithms like binary , merge , quick ..
* nums[i] == nums[i-1] is to prevent checking duplicate again. (This seems to be a good pattern which has been seen in other questions as well).
* Try to use **two way pointer**
* If you have to make patterns then you need to use the **recursive calls**
